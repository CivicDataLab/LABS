## Setup

### Fork

To contribute to LABS you have to fork the CivicDataLab/LABS repo.

You just have to fork once. You can call `git fetch upstream` and `git pull 'branch-name'` before you start your local changes to get the remote changes and be up-to-date.


### Setup Pre-Commit hook

Samoses uses `pre-commit` python package to make sure the formatting is right.

You can install using `pip install pre-commit`

Next, you just need to call `pre-commit install`
